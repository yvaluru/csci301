\begin{itemize}
\item You know how to compute $\pi$ to any precision.
  \pause
\item Given any real number, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, is there a computer
  program to compute it to any precision?
  \pause
\item How many computer programs are there?
\item Let $\mathbb{P} = \{ x : \mbox{$x$ is a computer program in Scheme}\}$.
  \pause
\item Each program, in binary, represents a different natural number.
  \pause
\item Therefore there is an injection $f : \mathbb{P} \rightarrow \nats$.
  \pause
\item Therefore $|P| \leq |\nats|$, and since $P$ is infinite, $|P| = |\nats|$.
  \pause
\item How many real numbers are there?  $|\mathbb{R}|$
  \pause
\item Therefore $|\mathbb{P}| < |\mathbb{R}|$.
  \pause
\item Therefore there exists a real number $x\in\mathbb{R}$
  that cannot be computed
  by any computer program.
\end{itemize}
